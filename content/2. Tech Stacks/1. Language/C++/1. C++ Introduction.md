### Arithmetic Circuits

### Stored Program Computer

### Instruction
![[Screen_Shot_2023-01-13_at_4.03.17_PM.png]]
- A sequence of bits that defines a single operation of a CPU
    - e.g. add, sub, read, write

### Instruction Set Architecture, ISA
- ISA is the specification of instructions supported by a CPU
    - The dictionary of CPU language
    - e.g. x86, RISC, …
- ISA is the interface between HW and SW
    - Different CPUs can run the same computer program as long as they support the same ISA

## Programming Languages
---
### Machine Language
![[Screen_Shot_2023-01-13_at_4.08.06_PM.png]]
- A language that is directly understood by the computer.
- Defined by ISA such as x86, RISC, …

### Symbolic Language
![[Screen_Shot_2023-01-13_at_4.08.20_PM.png]]
- English-like abbreviations representing elementary computer operations.
- e.g. Assembly language

### High-level Language
![[Screen_Shot_2023-01-13_at_4.08.31_PM.png]]
- Close to human language.
- e.g. C/C++, Java, Python, …

### Compiler
![[Screen_Shot_2023-01-13_at_4.10.20_PM.png]]
- Computers only understand binary code
- Humans write programs using a high-level language
- The `compiler` translates high-level language programs to binary code

### Compiled Languages
- Compiled language programs are compiled to binary machine code, which is then directly executed by the HW
- e.g. C/C++, Rust, Pascal, …
- Pros - fast
- Cons - need to re-compile on a different HW

### Interpreted Languages
- Programs are first compiled to an `Intermediate Representation, IR`, which is then converted by a `Virtual Machine, VM` to machine code and executed by the HW
- e.g. Java, Python, …
- Pros - better portability
- Cons - slow

## Basics of Computer Programming
---
### Computer Program (External View)
- Basic elements of a computer program
    - Input
    - Process
    - Output

### Computer Program (Internal View)
- A list of instructions ordered logically
- Usually, involve data access

### Developing a C++ Program
1. Coding
    - Write `source code` into a file
    - e.g. `hello.cpp`
2. Compile
    - Source code is converted to `object code` in machine language
    - e.g. `hello.obj`
3. Link
    - Combines objects and libraries to create a `binary executable`
    - e.g. `hello.exe`

## Function
---
```cpp
ReturnType FunctionName(input parameters)
{
    instructions within function body
}
```

- A sequence of instructions grouped together, which implement a specific task.

### main()
- `main()` is a special function, which is the starting point of a C++ program.

## Statement
---
```cpp
cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
```

- A syntactic unit that expresses some action to be carried out.

### cout
- An output function provided by `iostream` library
- `cout`
    - Console Output allows our program to output values to the standard output stream
- `<<`
    - output operator, which output values to an output device
    - The right-hand side of the `<<` is the string to output
- `endl`
    - end of the line. advance the cursor on the screen to the beginning of the next line

## `#include`
---
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
}
```

- Include the libraries you want to use
- e.g. `iostream` commonly used functions for I/O, including `cout`
- e.g. `cmath` commonly used math functions, such as `sin()` `cos()` `log()`

## using namespace
---
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
}
```

- `namespace`
    - A declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers inside it
    - Declare namespace to avoid writing the full name
- e.g. `std` namespace is used such that we can write `cout` instead of `std::cout`
