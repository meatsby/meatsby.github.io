## Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)
---
- Alternative to Amazon Kinesis
- Fully managed Apache Kafka on AWS
	- Allow you to create, update, and delete clusters
	- MSK creates & manages Kafka brokers nodes & Zookeeper nodes
	- Deploy the MSK cluster in VPC, multi-AZ (up to 3 for HA)
	- Automatic recovery from common Apache Kafka failures
	- Data is stored on EBS volumes for as long as you want
- MSK Serverless
	- Run Apache Kafka on MSk without managing the capacity
	- MSK automatically provisions resources and scales compute & storage
