## AWS Lake Formation
---
- Data lake = central place to have all data for analytics purposes
- Fully managed service that makes it easy to set up a data lake in days
- Discover, cleanse, transform, and ingest data into your Data Lake
- It automates many complex manual steps (collecting, cleansing, moving, cataloging data, ...) and de-duplicate (using ML Transforms)
- Combine structured and unstructured data in the data lake
- Out-of-the-box source blueprints: S3, RDS, Relational & NoSQL DB
- Fine-grained Access Control for applications (row and column level)
- Built on top of AWS Glue
