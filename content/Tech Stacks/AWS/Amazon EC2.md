## EC2 란
---
- Runs on top of physical host machines managed by AWS using virtualization technology
- A hypervisor running on the host machine is responsible for:
	- Sharing the underlying physical resources between the virtual machines
	- Coordinating this multitenancy
	- Isolating the virtual machines from each other as they share resources from the host
- DR features: AMIs, EBS snapshots
- Advantages
	- Integration with VPC, CloudTrail, IAM
	- Flexible, pay-as-you-go pricing model
- Amazon EC2 Pricing
	- On-Demand: You pay for only the compute time you use
	- Reserved Instances: `1-year or 3-year term`
		- Standard: Fixed EC2 type & Region
		- Convertible: Unfixed EC2 type & Region
	- EC2 Instance Savings Plans
		- Provides a discount when you make an `hourly spend commitment` to an instance family and Region for a `1-year or 3-year term`
	- Spot Instances
		- Use unused EC2 computing capacity and offer you cost savings at up to 90% off of On-Demand prices
	- Dedicated Hosts
		- `Physical servers` with EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use
- Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
	- A service that provides `block-level` storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances
	- `AZ level resource`
	- Need to be in the same AZ to attach EC2
	- Volumes do not automatically scale
- Elastic Load Balancer
	- Service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources
	- Application Load Balancer (L7: HTTP/HTTPS Routing)
	- Network Load Balancer (L4: TCP Routing)
