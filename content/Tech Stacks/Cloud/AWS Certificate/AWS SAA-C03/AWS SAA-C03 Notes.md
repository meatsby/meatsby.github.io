## AWS SAA-C03 Notes
---
- S3 Transfer Acceleration = Edge Location 으로 transfer 해서 transfer speed 올리는 법
- PrincipalOrgID = AWS Organization member accounts 만 접근 가능하게 for resource policies
- Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store
	- Secrets Manager = Auto Rotation
- CloudFront vs Global Accelerator (both support Shield for DDoS)
	- CloudFront = CDN for fast static content delivery, dynamic content (API acceleration)
		- Origin = S3, ALB, EC2, HTTP backend
	- Global Accelerator = Best routing by using Edge Locations
		- TCP/UDP, MQTT(IoT), VoIP, HTTP with static IP address
		- Provides static IP
- Network Firewall = provides filtering for both inbound and outbound network traffic
- GLB = L3 (IP Packets)
- EBS Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) = no latency on first use
- SSO + MSAD = two-way forest trust AWS Directory Service for MSAD
- AWS Config rules = to check resources that are not properly tagged
- AWS Shield Advanced = ELB, CF, GA, R53
- DR RPO/RTO order

- DDB PITR vs AWS Backup
	- PITR = recover table to any point in time in a rolling 35 day window
	- Backup = for long-term archiving and retention
- Glue Job Bookmarks = prevent re-processing old data
- S3 Legal Hold
    - Protect the object indefinitely, independent from the retention period
    - Can be freely placed and removed using the `s3:PutObjectLegalHold` IAM permission
- Control Tower & SCPs can prevent VPCs from having access to Internet
- CloudFront field-level encryption = allow to protect sensitive information throughout the application stack
- Storage Gateway = iSCSI
	- S3 File GW = extend storage space by leveraging Amazon S3, supports SMB
	- FSx File GW?
	- Volume GW
		- stored volumes = your primary data is stored locally and your entire dataset is available for low-latency access while asynchronously backed up to AWS
		- cached volumes = your primary data is written to S3, while retaining your frequently accessed data locally in a cache for low-latency access
	- Tape GW?
- S3 signed cookies & signed URLs for who do not have cookie support or unable to change hardcoded URLs
- Compute Savings Plan vs EC2 Instance Savings Plan
	- EC2 Instance Savings Plan = EC2 only & instance family committed
- S3 Storage Lens
	- Identify S3 buckets that are no longer being accessed or are rarely accessed
	- Identify versioning enabled
- S3 Inventory Report = List of unencrypted objects
- SQS FIFO vs SQS
	- FIFO = more expensive, guarantees processing exactly once
	- Standard = at least once
- FSx
	- Amazon FSx for Lustre = SMB
	- Amazon FSx for OpenZFS = NFS
	- Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP = NFS, SMB, iSCSI
- Lambda reserved concurrency vs provisioned concurrency
	- reserved concurrency?
	- provisioned concurrency
	- SnapStart for Java can improve startup performance for latency-sensitive applications by up to 10x at no extra cost

- Direct Connect vs VPN vs PrivateLink?
	- PrivateLink with VPC endpoint allows to connect services across different accounts and VPCs
- GW VPC Endpoint vs Interface VPC Endpoint
	- GW Endpoint = for S3 and DDB, doesn't allow from on-prem, peered VPCs in other Regions, or TGW
- Kinesis Firehose vs Streams
- io vs gp
	- gp2 vs gp3 = gp3 is cheaper and better
	- io1/2 supports Multi-Attach
- Global, Reduce latency, health checks, no failover = Amazon CloudFront
- Global ,Reduce latency, health checks, failover, Route traffic = Amazon Route 53
- Use Workload Discovery on AWS to generate architecture diagrams of the workloads
- Transfer Family supports AS2
- Amazon S3 Glacier:
    - Expedited Retrieval: Provides access to data within 1-5 minutes.
    - Standard Retrieval: Provides access to data within 3-5 hours.
    - Bulk Retrieval: Provides access to data within 5-12 hours.
- Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
    - Standard Retrieval: Provides access to data within 12 hours.
    - Bulk Retrieval: Provides access to data within 48 hours.
- X-Ray = trace the requests between the microservices
